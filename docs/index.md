Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are web applications that blend the best aspects of web and mobile apps. Developed using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, PWAs offer an enhanced user experience with features like offline access, responsive design, and app-like interactions. They work across various devices and browsers, load quickly, and are secure through HTTPS encryption. PWAs can be added to the home screen, making them easily accessible, and discoverable.
